# Le-Lenny-Lenguage
Le Lenny Lenguage is LE language for hardcore m'hackers. It makes all other languages look like ໒( ݓ Ĺ̯ ݓ )७ sad ugly plebs.
It's also charity-ware, so please donate all dongers that result from use of this language to feminism.

How often have we heard the complaint from today's beleagured myspace-addicted youth, "I'd love to learn the C Programming Language, but I can't figure it out! If only there was a simple millenial-readable unicode language!?" Now there is.

Only for Lenux.


Le Lennyonic Philosophy

1. 〳 ͡° Ĺ̯ ͡° 〵 we're not ilumanati ᕦ〳 ◑ ‸ ◑ 〵ᕤ
 
2. Emoticompiler does good optimization.

3. Get done with ambiuity

4. Le code extension is .txt, in order to be less intimidating to new programmers.
