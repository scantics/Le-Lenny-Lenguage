# Le-Lenny-Lenguage
Le Lenny Lenguage is LE language for hardcore m'hackers. It makes all other languages look like ໒( ݓ Ĺ̯ ݓ )७ sad ugly plebs.
It's also charity-ware, so please donate all dongers that result from use of this language to feminism.

How often have we heard the complaint from today's beleagured myspace-addicted youth, "I'd love to learn the C Programming Language, but I can't figure it out! If only there was a simple millenial-readable unicode language!?" Now there is.
